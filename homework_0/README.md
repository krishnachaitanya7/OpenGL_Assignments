# Homework - 1
Q1) The frame rate reported by the program when the window is different sizes, specifically 1x1, 300x300 and full screen. Explain your results.
   
Ans) When I run the gears program in my personal laptop with Intel i5 and integrated intel HD graphics with ubuntu 19.04 OS, on average below the statistics:  

| Resolution | FPS |  
|------------|-----|  
| 1 x 1      | 60   |  
| 300 x 300  | 60  |  
| 1024 x 768 | 60  |  

When I run the gears program in desktop PC with Intel Xeon with RTX 2080 Super graphics card with ubuntu 19.04 OS, on average below are the statistics

| Resolution | FPS |  
|------------|-----|  
| 1 x 1      | 60   |  
| 300 x 300  | 60  |  
| 1024 x 768 | 60  | 

You can see there is no difference between a laptop and powerful dekstop PC. A brief history of gears program is it's already included by default in most linux systems
and years before it was used as benchmarking program. Now there are a lot of improvements in OpenGL.


     
Q2) On some systems the frame rate is a small round number like 60 or 72 or 85 frames per second, and sometimes it is a large number, thousands or tens of thousands of frames per second. Explain why this occurs.  
Q3) Time required to complete the assignment.
Ans) 1.5 hours.
