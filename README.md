# Final Project
## By Kodur Krishna Chaitanya
Instruction to build:

1) Run build.sh: ./build.sh
2) The final_project executable should run automatically

Directions to use:   
↑: To move up  
↓: To move down  
b: To move backwards  
d: Toggle between day and night  
t: To toggle between sand and grass texture  
g: To toggle between fog and no fog  

## Project Overview
The view consists of a glider airplane that glides over dunes or rocky mountains (According to Texture, press "t" to toggle).  Toggling between day and night can be done by pressing "d". 
The glider can move upward (by pressing "↑"), downward(by pressing "↓"),  backward(by pressing "b"), and forward (by pressing "f"). 
Whenever the glider touches the mountains, it stops there, and fire erupts. It cannot move after this. At this point, restart the program. 
To toggle between fog and no fog press "g". 

Special features of this project are:  
- automatic Terrain Generation using fractals
- Fire using particle System when glider erupts into flames
- Fog

This final update also addresses Prof's comments if the glider can fly backwards

Finally I want to thank Prof for this wonderful class and the TA's who have been nothing but helpful
who also helped me outside the office hours. Thank you.
